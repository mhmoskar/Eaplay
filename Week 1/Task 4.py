def Sq(X):
    return X * X
A = 9
print(A, "squared",Sq(A))

#String = line 4 
#Subroutine = line 2
#Squared 9 = line 2
#Comma in line 4 = Used to split the string to put the variables in as placing A into "" would output "A squared Sq(A)" which is not what we want.
#cmd print = writes it in the console.
#Double quote "" = Used to output squared into the console as it is not a variable but a string. 
# Why is A = X = A = 9 thefore in the print it uses the variable of Sq() and replaces X with A which is 9 and then returns the answer of A squared.
